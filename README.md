# Hypothesis-testing
We aim to understand electric car usage for the Autolib electric car-sharing service company to investigate a claim that the number of blue cars taken on weekends and on weekdays are the same from the provided Autolib dataset.
We will identify some areas and periods of interest via sampling stating the reason to the choice of method, then perform hypothesis testing with regards to the claim
 
To work on this project, we will perform the following analysis with Python; 
Find and deal with outliers, anomalies, and missing data within the dataset.
Plot appropriate univariate and bivariate summaries recording our observations.
Implement the solution by performing hypothesis testing.
